# Software Requirements

## Vision

The Vision we have for our website is a Javascript based game that allows the user to hunt ducks and return a score based on their accuracy. We will be solving the pain point of boredom and a need for quick entertainment wherever the user has internet access. Our project should not be overlooked because our website can be a great stress reliever or reset for people in their busy daily lives. The thrill of a good game or competition can be a very powerful motivator.

## Scope (In/Out)

**IN:**

2. Users will be able to create a unique username in order to login in every time they revisit the website.
3. The website will provide the ability to have locally kept stats on the user's previously played games and the user's current highest score.
4. The website will be able to display the user's score and level in real time while playing the game.
5. The website will give the user the option to view the top 10 global high scores on a leader-board page to compare their own high score.

**OUT:**

1. The website will never turn into an IOS or Android app.
2. The website will not run from a database or server and will only use local storage.
