            <p>
                Harper currently lives in Seattle with his wife, two boys (3 & 1 y/o), and 90lbs labradoodle.
                Originally from Uvalde, TX he grew up doing all the quintessential Texan activities like hunting,
                fishing, shooting competitively, and competing in the rodeo, as well as some “less Texan” activities
                such as playing tennis.
                After graduating high school, Harper attended the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, MD and
                commissioned as a Special Operations Bomb Disposal Officer.
                In 2021, he transitioned from active duty into the private sector where he worked in Tech M&A advisory
                for Houlihan Lokey.
                He recently left his role as an investment banker to pursue software development and currently runs
                Rainier Racing Co., a Play-To-Earn Gaming NFT market analysis company.

                My Name is Gordon Patrick Reilley Jr. This quite possibly is the most  Irish name you will ever hear, but
                you might not even realize I am Irish by looking at me. This is because my Mother is Native American and
                I resemble her greatly. Strong genes I guess! I am married and have an 8 month old baby boy and yes he
                is the III (third). I am currently living in Maryland learning to code at Code Fellows in order to land
                a job in the tech industry. I am a former Naval Aircrewman for the United States Navy and after 7 years
                of service I can say I had a great time but I am looking forward to my next step in becoming a software
                engineer. I love the outdoors as much as I love being at the computer, the challenge is balancing the
                two! With all that being said, I hope you learned a thing or two about me and enjoy the our website. Can
                you beat my high-score?

            <p>
                Ian lives just outside of Seattle with his wife, Leyla, and their goldendoodle named Ramen and their
                snowshoe cat named Sushi. Prior to attending Code Fellows Tech Academy, Ian was working in sales at a
                concrete company (super exciting stuff, I know). Before the concrete company, Ian held all kinds of
                jobs; he was a fraud investigator at Amazon, an English teacher in China, a waiter, a cook, and even a
                wildland firefighter for one summer. He grew up in Eugene, Oregon, and moved to China after graduating
                from the University of Oregon. After China, he returned to the US and ended up in Seattle. He’s a big
                fan of the outdoors and all kinds of sports, his favorites are basketball, snowboarding, skateboarding,
                ultimate frisbee & disc golf. He also found while remodeling his house that he loves carpentry &
                woodworking. He’s also somewhat obsessed with fantasy novels and his favorite series is the Stormlight
                Archive, by Brandon Sanderson.
                Ian is looking forward to building his technical skill set during this boot camp, so that he can get a
                job that will give him and his little family a better life, and he hopes he will be able to use those
                skills to do some good in this world!

                Keyan lives in upstate South Carolina with his wife Whitney and his daughter Alice.They have 2 cats
                Jekyll and Clyde (yes this was intentional). Prior to attending Code Fellows, Keyan spent 4 years in the
                United States Marine Corps as an 0311 Infantryman. Upon exiting the Marine Corps, Keyan was in search of
                what to do with his life next. He took on an apprenticeship working in a factory that built gas tanks
                for a variety of vehicles. He knew right away this wasn't a long term solution. The timing worked out
                perfectly because at the same time Solana NFT's took off. As soon as he got involved he was hooked. He
                now works towards becoming a full-stack software developer so he can return to the community with the
                ability to be involved in and help build out the next generation of the web (web3).
