A JavaScript based game where the goal is to shoot down ducks. Based on the Nintendo classic "Duck Hunt", our game pays homage to a true classic while also flexing the teams skills at HTML, CSS, and  vanilla JavaScript.

### Reflections and Comments

* Google is your friend
* VS Code and GitHub Pages accept different syntax for linking files in the same repo together
* Learned to prioritize features for delivering an MVP within alloted timeframes (i.e. make the *Minimum* Viable Product the *minimum*)
* Accept that bugs are a feature of the software development process
* The ability to rapidly diagnose and debug a program is just as important as being able to write robust code
