### Conflict Resolution Process

* When conflicts arise, the group will hold a whole group discussion to address the issue

  * Conversations will focus on the problem, they will not become personal
  * At the end of the discussion, the group will hold a vote, majority rules
    * If a tie arises, call in a TA to break the tie
* If a team member is taking over the project, other team members will call the behavior to the attention of the group
  * Team will discuss why they feel the project has been taken over
  * After a discussion focusing on the behavior, the team will continue on with the project
  * The offending team member will be allowed one more violation
  * On the third offense, team will escalate to a TA
* If a team member is struggling with a task, they shall be allowed to keep working for a maximum of 1 hour before calling a mandatory team meeting in Remo to address the problem
  * If the problem is not solvable by the team in Remo after 30 minutes, the team shall call a TA to assist
* If a team member is not contributing to the project, other team members will call the behavior to the attention of the group
  * Team will discuss why they feel the team member is not contributing and specific tasks they have failed to deliver on
  * After a discussion focusing on the behavior, the team will continue on with the project
  * The offending team member will be allowed one more violation
  * On the third offense, team will escalate to a TA

* Task Tracking
  * Tasks will be tracked via Google Sheets

  * Once a task is completed, the responsible team member will remove the task from "in progress" and move it to the "done" column
* "Meaty" Problems
  * Team will break down into pairs to conduct pair programming to tackle difficult problems that we cannot solve during our normal work flow

## Git Process

* Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:
  * How will you communicate that itâ€™s time to merge?

* All documents and files associated with the project, other than out Task Tracker and Pitch Deck, will live on GitHub
  * Links to Task Tracker and Pitch Deck will be pinned in our Slack channel
* All team members will be added to a new Git Organization and have access to the project repository
* Git Flow
  * For development, we will make a working branch and merge all new features onto the working branch
  * Each team member will will create another branch specific to their feature for development
  * Before merging into the working branch, the team member will create a pull request and alert the team that a code review is necessary
    * Alerts will be sent out via Slack or Remo, depending on where the majority of the team is at the time
  * The pull request *must* be reviewed by a minimum of two other team members
  * Once the code has been reviewed, the team will merge the feature branch onto the working branch
  * Once all features are completed, the whole team will approve merging into the main branch
